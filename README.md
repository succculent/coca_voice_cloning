## Coca Voice Cloning
USC Corpus Callosum voice cloning project 2018-2019

# What is it

This is a yearlong project done in the Corpus Callosum (CoCa) club at USC. We wrote an algorithm, with research into Baidu and DeepMind's voice cloning algorithms, in cloning a voice. While this project was not very successful, this was an important introduction into many specific subjects in computer science that we now know and use... Machine Learning, Transfer Learning, Data Processing, Sound Embedding, Lingual Embedding, and Phoneme Extraction.

# What is next

While we have stopped development on this project. Our final goal was to use a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) along with a neural muscle sensor to detect and decode human muscle sub-vocalizations - the neural muscle movements in the jaw and neck which are prerequisitory to speech. We wanted to then use our cloned voice to project in a different voice. Our hopes were to test this with people unable to speak due to injury or trauma, but also as a fun way of changing your voice.
